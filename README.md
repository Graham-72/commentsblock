<h1>About Comments Block for BackdropCMS</h1>
-------------------------

This module is a port to Backdrop of the Drupal contributed module 'Commentsblock'. 
It puts the comments and the comment form from a module into a block which can then be placed 
in a different location within a layout.

There are options to suppress display of the 'add new comment' button from within the node, and
also to stop comments being shown to users who are not able to comment themselves.

<h2>Status</h2>
This port to Backdrop is ready for installation and testing but is not yet proven reliable.

<h3>Acknowledgement</h3>

This port to Backdrop would not, of course, be possible without all the work done by the developers 
and maintainers of the Drupal module.
